# TInGa
This is a repository hosting the implementation of TinGa, a trajectory inference method based on growing neural gas [^1].

The scripts and functions in this package can be used to:

* Run TInGa on any dataset (TInGa will also perform dimensionality reduction as a first step)
* Run top performing trajectory inference methods such as Slingshot, PAGA, Monocle3, RaceID/StemID
* Generate figures to compare the performance of TInGa to other methods
