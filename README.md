# TInGa
This is a repository hosting the implementation of TinGa, a trajectory inference method based on growing neural gas [1].

The scripts and functions in this package can be used to:

* Run TInGa on any dataset (TInGa will also perform dimensionality reduction as a first step)
* Run top performing trajectory inference methods such as Slingshot [2], PAGA [3], Monocle3 [4], RaceID/StemID [5]
* Generate figures to compare the performance of TInGa to other methods
